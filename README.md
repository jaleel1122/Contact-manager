# 📱 Contact Manager App

A **React-based Contact Manager** with full **CRUD functionality**, built to practice and apply almost every major React concept along with **JSON Server** for backend simulation.  
This project started as a way to explore React basics, but gradually grew into a **mini-capstone app** covering components, hooks, routing, API integration, and state management.

## ✨ Features  
- **Add New Contacts** → Create and save contacts using JSON Server  
- **Edit & Update** → Modify existing contacts  
- **Delete** → Remove contacts from the list  
- **Search** → Real-time filtering of contacts with input + `useRef` optimization  
- **Routing** → Navigate between pages (Home, Add, Edit, Details) using React Router  
- **Persistent Data** → JSON Server acts as a REST API for saving data  
- **Reusable Components** → Built with functional and class components  
- **Responsive & Styled** → Used Semantic UI + custom styles


## 📚 What I Learned  
This project helped me practice almost **every major React topic**:  

- **React Basics** → JSX, Functional Components, Class Components  
- **Props & State** → Passing data/functions as props, managing state updates  
- **Hooks** → `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef` for controlled input and search  
- **React Router** → Routing, navigation, route state, dynamic params  
- **JSON Server** → Backend simulation with full REST API support (CRUD)  
- **Axios** → Handling API requests and responses cleanly  
- **Search & Filter** → Implemented search with `Array.filter()` and controlled inputs  
- **Styling** → Inline styles, images, Semantic UI 


## ⚙️ Installation & Setup  
1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaleel1122/Contact-manager.git
   cd Contact-manager

2. **Install dependencies** 
   ```bash
   npm install
   
3. **Run JSON Server (for backend simulation)**
    ```bash
    npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001

4. **Start React App** 
    ```bash
    npm start


I’m proud of how this turned out — it shows how far I’ve come since my first React app.  
This one helped me connect all React concepts together—from rendering components, managing state, and routing, to integrating with a backend service.
